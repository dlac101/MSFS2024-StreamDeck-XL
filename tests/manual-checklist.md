# Manual test checklist

Copy the relevant section into a dated note (or the CHANGELOG) each time you run it.
Record: date, MSFS 2024 version, PilotsDeck version, aircraft.

## Phase 1: four-key proof of concept (C172 G1000)

Setup: cold and dark or parked, profile `MSFS2024 C172 POC` active.

**Connection**
- [ ] Keys show the hourglass while the sim loads, then live content once in the cockpit.
- [ ] Heading key shows a 3-digit heading that changes as the aircraft turns (taxi or slew).

**Stream Deck -> sim**
- [ ] Battery key turns the battery on; the cockpit switch moves and the key shows "on".
- [ ] Battery key turns it off again.
- [ ] Parking brake key sets and releases the brake.
- [ ] With battery and avionics on, AP key engages and disengages the autopilot.

**Sim -> Stream Deck (the important one)**
- [ ] Battery switched with the mouse: key updates without being pressed.
- [ ] Parking brake changed with the mouse: key updates.
- [ ] AP engaged/disengaged with the mouse on the G1000 (or AP disconnect on the controller): key updates.

**Restart survival**
- [ ] Quit to main menu and reload the flight: keys recover by themselves.
- [ ] Restart MSFS: keys recover.
- [ ] Quit and restart the Stream Deck app: the profile and all four keys are intact.

**Controller independence**
- [ ] All of the above works flying with the Xbox Elite controller.
- [ ] All of the above works flying with the T.16000M + TWCS.

**Disconnected sim**
- [ ] With MSFS closed, keys show the plugin's idle preview, not a stale "on" state.

**Profile round trip**
- [ ] Exported profile saved to `pilotsdeck/MSFS2024-XL/_Package/Profiles/`.
- [ ] Re-imported copy works the same as the original.

## Phase 2: main page (C172 G1000)

Setup: profile `MSFS2024 C172 G1000` active, main page (its first page) built as in
[docs/phase2-main-page.md](../docs/phase2-main-page.md). C172 G1000 loaded cold and dark. Wait until the
keys no longer show the Wait image (hourglass) before judging any key: B-Var keys can show Off or the
Fault image while the flight loads.

Record: date, MSFS 2024 version, PilotsDeck version, aircraft, and for each fallback or changed value
below, which one you used.

**Diagnostic first (before the tests below)**
- [ ] For each B-Var switch key (FUEL PMP, NAV LT, BCN, STRB, LDG, TAXI, PITOT): flip the cockpit switch
  with the mouse, both ways, and watch the key. Three cases:
  - The key shows On when the switch is on and Off when it is off: the values are `1`/`0`. Nothing to change.
  - The key shows the Fault image (Special State) in either position: that value is something else.
  - The key doesn't change, or shows On and Off the wrong way round: the B-Var doesn't follow the switch
    as set up.

  In the last two cases, put the address in a temporary Display Value key (Value: Address = the B-Var,
  no Format) to read the raw on and off values, and record them here. If the raw value changes with the
  switch, the key's On/Off values change to what you find; if it doesn't change at all, use that key's
  fallback in the doc and record it.
- [ ] Temporary Display Value key with `(A:FLAPS NUM HANDLE POSITIONS, number)`: record the number
  (the FLAPS mapping assumes 4 positions, `0` to `3`). `3` or `4` both fit, since the SDK doesn't say
  whether UP counts; the flaps-lever line below decides. Delete the temporary key afterwards.
- [ ] COM1 key: record what it shows for active and standby compared with the PFD (e.g. `118.000` /
  `121.500`). Nonsense numbers: try the COM1 fallback in the doc and record which one works. With the
  BCD16 fallback, if it shows `11850.00`, set Scalar `0.01`.
- [ ] XPDR key: record what it shows compared with the PFD code (e.g. `1200`). Wrong number: try the
  XPDR fallback (unit `number`, Decode BCD unchecked) and record which one works.
- [ ] BARO key: record which altimeter index the PFD baro was seen on. Turn the PFD baro knob with the
  mouse; the key follows with `:1` = index 1. If it doesn't, try `:2` (then `:3`) and record the index
  that follows the PFD.
- [ ] Press BARO with the index found: does the PFD baro change? (yes/no)

**Sim -> Stream Deck (the important one: change the control with the mouse, don't press the key)**
- [ ] Battery switch: BAT key follows.
- [ ] Electric fuel pump switch: FUEL PMP key follows.
- [ ] Parking brake: PARK key follows.
- [ ] Flaps lever through every notch, down and up: FLAPS shows `UP`, `10`, `20`, `30` in step.
- [ ] NAV light switch: NAV LT key follows.
- [ ] Beacon switch: BCN key follows.
- [ ] Strobe switch: STRB key follows.
- [ ] Landing light switch: LDG key follows.
- [ ] Taxi light switch: TAXI key follows.
- [ ] Pitot heat switch: PITOT key follows.
- [ ] With battery and avionics on, on the G1000 bezel: AP on/off, AP key follows.
- [ ] HDG mode on/off: HDG key follows.
- [ ] ALT mode on/off: ALT key follows.
- [ ] VS mode on/off: VS key follows.
- [ ] NAV mode with the CDI on GPS: NAV (row 2) key follows.
- [ ] NAV mode with the CDI on VLOC (LOC1/VOR1): NAV (row 2) key follows.
- [ ] APR mode on/off: APR key follows.
- [ ] FLC mode on/off: FLC key follows.
- [ ] FD on/off: FD key follows.
- [ ] COM1 swap on the PFD: COM1 key's active and standby swap. Tune the standby frequency: the key follows.
- [ ] Change the transponder code on the PFD: XPDR key follows.
- [ ] Turn the baro knob, then press the BARO softkey / STD: BARO key follows both.
- [ ] Press the CDI softkey on the PFD: CDI key changes between `GPS` and `VLOC`.
- [ ] Move the throttle: RPM key follows the engine RPM (engine running).
- [ ] GEAR key shows `FIXED`.

**Stream Deck -> sim (press the key; the cockpit changes, then the key shows the new state)**
- [ ] BAT turns the battery on and off.
- [ ] FUEL PMP turns the fuel pump on and off.
- [ ] PARK sets and releases the parking brake.
- [ ] FLAPS press: one notch down each press, down to 30. Long press: one notch up each time, back to UP.
  (Want them the other way round? Note it; the two commands get swapped.)
- [ ] NAV LT, BCN, STRB, LDG, TAXI, PITOT each switch their cockpit switch on and off.
- [ ] AP, HDG, ALT, VS, NAV (row 2), APR, FLC, FD each switch their mode on and off on the G1000.
- [ ] COM1 press swaps active and standby on the PFD.
- [ ] CDI press switches the PFD's CDI source.
- [ ] BARO press sets the altimeter to sea-level pressure (or 29.92 above 18000 ft).
- [ ] ATC press opens the ATC window; a second press closes it.
- [ ] MAP press opens the flight map.
- [ ] ATC or MAP does nothing: that key becomes Empty and its row in aircraft-mappings.md is marked
  "does not work" (the row stays). Record which.

**Disconnected sim**
- [ ] With MSFS closed: every key shows its idle preview; none shows a stale "on" state or a stale value.
- [ ] While the sim loads: keys show the Wait image.
- [ ] After the flight loads: live values on every key within a few seconds.

**Unavailable value** (not a Phase 4 test)
- [ ] Switch to another default aircraft and back, or start the sim to the main menu only: no key claims
  a misleading state. Record what each key showed.
- [ ] Flight loaded cold and dark, battery off: record what COM1, XPDR, BARO, CDI and RPM show (record only).

**Restart survival**
- [ ] Quit to main menu and reload the flight: keys recover by themselves.
- [ ] Restart MSFS: keys recover.
- [ ] Quit and restart the Stream Deck app: the profile and all 26 keys are intact.

**Controller independence**
- [ ] All of the above works flying with the Xbox Elite controller.
- [ ] All of the above works flying with the T.16000M + TWCS.

**Result for the worker**
- [ ] Record which keys passed Sim -> Stream Deck, which passed Stream Deck -> sim, every fallback used,
  every On/Off value or index that changed, and the altimeter index seen.
